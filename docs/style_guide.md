# Style Guide

This document outlines the preferred writing and annotation conventions for materials in this repository.

## Language and tone

- Write in clear, concise English.
- Use plain language and avoid unnecessary jargon.
- When citing sources in markdown documents, use the citation format `【citation_id†screenshot】` with anchor lines.

## Markdown formatting

- Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure documents logically.
- For tables, keep them narrow and use them for concise data (keywords, phrases, numbers). Do not embed long sentences inside table cells.
- Lists should use hyphens (`-`) for unordered lists or numbers for ordered lists.

## Coding style

- Python scripts should follow PEP 8 guidelines (e.g., 4-space indentation, descriptive variable names).
- When writing YAML or JSON files, ensure proper indentation and quoting.

## File content

- Each `GUIDE.md` should explain the purpose of its folder and provide instructions for adding or updating files.
- Include commit messages that succinctly describe changes when adding files.

## Citation and attribution

- Include citations to external sources where appropriate, using the citation format above.
- Respect licenses of original policy documents; note the source URL and date accessed in metadata.

This style guide helps maintain consistency and readability across the project.

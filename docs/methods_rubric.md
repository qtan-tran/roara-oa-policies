# OA Mandate Strength Rubric

This document explains how OA policy strength is categorized for the project. Strength is evaluated using five elements: bindingness of language, explicit deposit timelines and acceptable versions, rights-retention guidance, existence of compliance structures, and supportive mechanisms such as funds or platforms. Elements related to enforceability (language, timelines, rights-retention, monitoring) carry greater weight than support alone.

## Categories
- **High** – Mandates with binding language, specified deposit window and version, rights-retention guidance, and clear monitoring structures (e.g. mandatory registration, central reporting).
- **Medium-High** – Strong expectations with assertive language, approximate deposit timeline and version specified, rights-retention advised, and some monitoring or recognition mechanisms.
- **Medium** – Policies that encourage OA and include at least one operational requirement (e.g. deposit window or version) but lack consistent rights guidance or monitoring.
- **Weak/Medium** – Advisory statements that include minimal operational guidance or infrastructure, such as a publication fund or IR recommendation, without deposit timelines or compliance structures.
- **Weak** – Broad aspirations to support OA without any time-bound deposit guidance, rights-retention advice or compliance monitoring.

These categories help harmonize varying policy language for comparative analysis.

# Reports Folder Guide

This folder contains outputs such as manuscripts and slides prepared from the analysis.

- `manuscript/`: Contains article drafts, references, and any journal-specific guidelines. Provide `paper.md` as the manuscript body, `references.bib` for bibliography, and `journal_requirements.md` summarizing the target journalâ€™s submission instructions.
- `slides/`: Contains presentation slide decks (e.g. .pptx). Use a `.gitkeep` file to ensure the directory exists in version control.

When preparing reports, import figures and tables from `analysis/outputs` rather than generating them in-place. Follow the style guide for writing and formatting and include citations in the bibliography file.

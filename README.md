# ROARA OA Policies

This repository hosts open access policy texts (Germany, RPOs), normalized datasets, and transparent methods for qualitative/content analysis conducted as part of the ROARA project. The structure is designed to separate raw sources, processed data, methods, analysis scripts, and reports to ensure clarity and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure

- **policies/**: Canonical policy texts as PDFs with extracted text and metadata.
- **data/**: Raw and processed tables with controlled vocabularies for analysis.
- **methods/**: Codebooks, rubric definitions, sampling strategies, and reliability protocols.
- **snippets/**: Annotated excerpts from policy documents with codes and memos.
- **analysis/**: Notebooks and scripts for building tables and conducting analyses.
- **reports/**: Drafts of manuscripts, slides, and other dissemination outputs.
- **templates/**: Reusable metadata templates and checklists.
- **qa/**: Validation rules and linting scripts for data quality assurance.
- **docs/**: Human en readable guides and documentation for contributors.

Each subfolder contains a `GUIDE.md` file explaining how to add, organize, and validate files in that section. See `docs/` for an overview of naming conventions, data dictionary, and style guidelines.

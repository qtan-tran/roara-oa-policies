# Codebook

This codebook defines the codes and categories used to annotate open access policy texts in the ROARA project. Each code corresponds to a concept or attribute that is systematically captured during content analysis.

## Codes and Descriptions

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| deposit.binding | Use of binding verbs indicating deposit is required (e.g., "shall", "must"). |
| deposit.encouraged | Advisory language encouraging deposit without making it mandatory. |
| deposit.window | Explicit time frame for deposit (e.g., at publication, â‰¤12 months). |
| rights.retention | Guidance for authors to retain rights for self-archiving. |
| compliance.monitoring | Presence of compliance or monitoring mechanisms. |
| support.funding | Information on institutional funding or APC support. |
| scope.data | Inclusion of research data or OER in scope. |

Add additional codes as needed, following the pattern above. Ensure the table remains updated as new codes are introduced in the analysis.

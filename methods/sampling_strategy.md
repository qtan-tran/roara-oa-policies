# Sampling Strategy

This document outlines the sampling strategy used for selecting open access policies included in the ROARA study. The aim is to ensure coverage across institution types, geographical regions, and policy characteristics.

## Inclusion Criteria

- Policies must be publicly available at the institutional level (research-performing organizations).
- Policies must relate to open access to scholarly outputs, including publications, research data, and teaching materials.
- Duplicate or superseded policies are excluded.

## Sampling Approach

Policies are compiled exhaustively for all German research-performing organizations and then iteratively expanded to other national contexts. Each policy is assigned an identifier using the naming conventions defined in `docs/naming_conventions.md`. Updates and amendments are tracked through version control.

Explain any stratified or random sampling methods here if applicable.

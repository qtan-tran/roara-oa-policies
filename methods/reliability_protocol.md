# Reliability Protocol

This document describes the intercoder reliability procedures for the ROARA project.

## Coding Team

Briefly describe the coding team composition and training.

## Procedure

- Coders independently code a common subset of policies using the codebook.
- After initial coding, calculate intercoder reliability metrics (e.g., Cohen's kappa) for each code.
- Discuss discrepancies and refine codebook definitions.
- Repeat coding and reliability calculations until acceptable agreement is achieved.

## Adjudication

Describe how disagreements are resolved (e.g., through discussion or a third coder).

Document each round of reliability assessment, adjustments made to the codebook, and final agreement levels.

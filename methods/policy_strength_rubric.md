# Policy Strength Rubric

This rubric defines the categories used to classify the strength of open access mandates in institutional policies. The rubric is elaborated in `docs/methods_rubric.md`, and reproduced here for convenience.

## Strength Levels

- **High**: Binding language requiring deposit, explicit time-bound windows, specified versions (VoR/AAM), rights-retention guidance, and compliance monitoring.
- **Medium-High**: Strong expectations with implied timeframes and version requirements, some monitoring and rights-retention guidance.
- **Medium**: Encouragement of deposit with some operational elements but lacking monitoring and rights-retention detail.
- **Weak/Medium**: Advisory statements with minimal operational guidance and limited support.
- **Weak**: Aspirational language encouraging open access without specified deposit windows, version requirements, or compliance mechanisms.

Refer to the rubric when coding each policyâ€™s mandate strength.
